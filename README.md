Project 1 - Noise

Using perlin noise and a smoothing function, I manipulated the vertices of a icosahedron mesh to create a random looking smoothed surface. I animated the vertices by offsetting the their positions using time. I also including music to displace the vertices of the mesh depending on the sound frequency.

GUI controls :-

- fov : Change camera field of view
- speed : Change animation speed
- volume : change music volume
