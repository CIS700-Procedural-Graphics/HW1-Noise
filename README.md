# [Project 1: Noise](https://github.com/CIS700-Procedural-Graphics/Project1-Noise)

## Description
Implementation of 3D multioctave noise algorithm using three.js and its shader support.

## Features Implemented
a. Original isodecahedron mesh deformed using multioctave noise values as an offset to the surface. 
b. Animated mesh by using a uniform time variable to offset the parameters of the noise function. 
c. Adjustable sliders to change persistance and color.
d. Background Music.
