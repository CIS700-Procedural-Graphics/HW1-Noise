# [Project 1: Noise](https://github.com/CIS700-Procedural-Graphics/Project1-Noise)

View the project [here](https://sknop8.github.io/Project1-Noise/).

## Overview

This is a 3D visual representation of a multi-octave noise algorithm, an exercise using three.js and its shader support. The output is a continous surface deformation of a sphere mesh, with lots of customization capabilites to allow users to create interesting results.

### Noise Features
Continous, multi-octave noise
- Approximately 50 octaves of pseudo-randomly generated noise
- Cosine interpolated between lattice values

### Interactive Features
Using dat.GUI

1. Mesh color control
	a. Base color
	b. Outer color (based on the generated noise)
	c. Inner color (based on the generated noise)
2. Stripes
	a. Stripe density control
	b. Stripe color control
3. Pattern (procedurally generated by finding mod intersections between 2 different noise outputs)
	a. Pattern density control
	b. Pattern color control
