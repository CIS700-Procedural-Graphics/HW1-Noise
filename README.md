# [Project 1: Noise](https://github.com/CIS700-Procedural-Graphics/Project1-Noise)

## Features implemented
- 2 new shaders: icosahedron-vert and icosahedron-frag
- 3 noise functions: noise1, noise2 and noise3
- 2 interpolation functions: linear and cosine
- interpolate noise function that uses noise1 to perform a 3D lattice-based interpolation
- multi-ocatave noise generation function that uses the the interpolate noise function, but this time uses noise2 and 3 as well rather than just noise1
- applied the noise in action and made a jelly-bean like deformation
- animation applied 
- reading from explosion png provided by adam for visual impact
- added a noise scale slider to adjust the influence of the noise on the icosahedron

## Features to come
- Music
- Better multi-octave noise 

## Screenshots to come soon as well
