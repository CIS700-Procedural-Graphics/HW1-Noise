# [Project 1: Noise](https://github.com/CIS700-Procedural-Graphics/Project1-Noise)

#### [Check out the project here!](https://sknop8.github.io/Project1-Noise/)

## Overview

A 3D visual representation of multi-octave noise written using [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and its shader support, and [dat.GUI](https://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/#1--Basic-Usage). The output is a continous surface deformation of a sphere mesh, with lots of customization capabilites to allow users to create interesting results!

### Noise Features
Continous, multi-octave noise
- Approximately 50 octaves of pseudo-randomly generated noise
- Cosine interpolation between lattice values

### Interactive Features

1. Mesh color control    
a. Base color    
b. Outer color (based on the generated noise)    
c. Inner color (based on the generated noise)     
2. Stripes (based on noise offset)      
a. Stripe density control     
b. Stripe color control          
3. Pattern (procedurally generated by finding mod intersections between 2 different noise outputs)     
a. Pattern density control      
b. Pattern color control	
4. Pixelate mesh     
a. Control pixelate power (how much pixelization)    

## About
